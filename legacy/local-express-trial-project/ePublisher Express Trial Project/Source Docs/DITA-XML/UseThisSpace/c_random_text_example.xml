  <p>Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point. When you click 
  Online Video, you can paste the embed code for the video you want to add. You can
  also type a keyword to search online for the video that best fits your document. To
  make your document look professionally produced, Word provides header, footer, 
  cover page, and text box designs that complement each other. For example, you can 
  add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the 
  elements you want from the different galleries. Themes and styles also help keep 
  your document coordinated.</p>
  <p>When you click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt
  graphics change to match your new theme. When you apply styles, your headings 
  change to match the new theme. Save time in Word with new buttons that show up 
  where you need them. To change the way a picture fits in your document, click it 
  and a button for layout options appears next to it. When you work on a table, click
  where you want to add a row or a column, and then click the plus sign. Reading is 
  easier, too, in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts of the document and 
  focus on the text you want.</p>
