	Creating expand/collapse sections are accomplished by setting the boundaries of an expansion 
	section through ePublisher paragraph styles. In DITA ePublisher paragraph styles are applied 
	through the outputclass attribute. For example, if you wanted to apply the ePublisher paragraph 
	style <b>body</b> to a paragraph in a DITA topic, you would mark the paragraph like this:
    </p>
    <p>     <codeph><b>&lt;p outputclass="body"&gt;</b></codeph></p>	
	<p>In this example, the procedure list below has the ExpandCollapse output class applied to the
	<codeph>&lt;Title&gt;</codeph> element. Because the Stationery Designer defined the output class 
	ExpandCollapse with the Expand/Collapse feature, the procedure introductory statement displays a
	trigger next to it, and when users click the trigger, the steps in the procedure will display.
    </p>
	<p>In DITA, everything contained in the file will be included in the Expand/Collapse field. As a 
	result, when creating an Expand/Collapse section, all the information should be written in a single
	Task.
