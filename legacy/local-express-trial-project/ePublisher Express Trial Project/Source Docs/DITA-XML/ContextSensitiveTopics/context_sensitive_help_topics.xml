<title>Context-Sensitive Help Topics</title>
<shortdesc>This section explains how you can create context-sensitive
help topics in ePublisher.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>The Context-Sensitive help feature in software products is a result of a combined effort
	from the developers of the product along with the content creators for the product. This section
	is an example of what the content creators would need to accomplish to do their part in bringing
	context-sensitive help to their customers. You will create a context-sensitive help topic using the
	sample ePublisher Express Trial source documents and stationery. For the trial, you will only create
	the topic. In a real-world example, you would then hand that topic off to the developers so they could
	include the path at the right location in the product.
