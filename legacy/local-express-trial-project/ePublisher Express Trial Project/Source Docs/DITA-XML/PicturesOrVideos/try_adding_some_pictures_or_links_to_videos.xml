<title>Try Adding Some Pictures or Links to Videos</title>
<shortdesc>This section is for you to add your multimedia assets to get a feel for
how they work with ePublisher.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
  <p>For now, we recommend just using the native functions of your authoring tool to
  add your media assets inline. You will see them appear in the output in the same 
  manner. If you have a DITA authoring tool, then just use it to create links to 
  images or videos.</p>
  <p>When you have a full seat of ePublisher, you will be able to change some of the
  asset behaviors in the generated output, but for now, you can see how easy it is 
  to add multimedia to your outputs.</p>
