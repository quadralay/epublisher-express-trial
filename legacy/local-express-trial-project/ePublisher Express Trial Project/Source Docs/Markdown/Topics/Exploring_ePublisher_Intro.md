**ePublisher Express** uses a **One-Click Publishing** workflow. This workflow gives content creators more time to spend on documentation by providing a streamlined and efficient publishing work flow which helps increases product value and customer loyalty. With the **One-Click Publishing** work flow, content creators can customize output by placing cues or markers in the source documents. We at WebWorks understand that this type of work flow sounds like it can be complicated as mediums change and documentation grows, but with **ePublisher** it can be simple and efficient in any environment. To accomplish this, we developed the unique concept of the **ePublisher Stationery**.
	
**ePublisher Stationery** is created in **ePublisher Designer** and then used by **ePublisher Express** in publishing jobs. **ePublisher Stationery** holds content styling information as well as instructions about the look and feel of the output. By creating and using Stationery to define and store publishing behavior, as content changes and grows, republishing new content with the same look and feel is as simple as a single click  in **ePublisher Express**. Using the **One-Click Publishing** work flow, content creators know when it comes time to deliver, they can rely on the **ePublisher Stationery** to ensure that output generated will display properly for all audiences across all mediums. It does not matter how difficult the job, **ePublisher** can deliver to you – **One-Click Publishing**.
	
To demonstrate the efficiency and ease of **ePublisher** **One-Click Publishing** work flow, when you requested and installed an **ePublisher Express Trial**, we supplied you with an **ePublisher Express** Project, pre-built **ePublisher Stationery**, and source documents . These can be found in the Documents area of your computer, in the folder "***ePublisher Express Projects***" and "**ePublisher Stationery**".

When you open the **Express** project for the first time, **ePublisher** will automatically load this **Express** project and you will follow the steps in the guide to load the source documents of your preferred format. This setup allows you to quickly and easily publish a HTML5 document set and PDF to learn more about our **One-Click Publishing** work flow. After you go through the **ePublisher Trial Guide**, if you would like a deeper understanding on how to customize **ePublisher Stationery** for your source documents, or multiple medium deliveries, visit the “*Next Steps*” window on the start page of your **ePublisher Express Trial** project.

# About the Sample ePublisher Express Trial Source Documents

These Webworks sample source documents contain predetermined paragraph and character styles, marker types, conditions, variables, and cross-reference definitions that you can use to explore **ePublisher** capabilities and generate output. For example, the Webworks sample source documents contain sample paragraph styles, such as Heading 1, Heading 2, Title, and Body paragraph styles, and sample character styles, such as Bold and Emphasis, that are common in most source documents. These are not ment to show you all of **ePublisher's** capabilities, but to give you enough information to make an informed decision. 
	
The sample source documents provided were created to be used in the following ways:
	
 1. You can follow the instructions in the **ePublisher Express Trial Guide** (located on the start page.) The **ePublisher Express Trial Guide** will give you a good idea of how to use the **ePublisher** interface and it will explain the design of our HTML5 document set. It then takes you through some tasks using the **ePublisher** system. During those tasks, you will use the instructions in this document to edit the source before generating the HTML5 document set. Once generated, you will verify your work in the HTML5 document set then return to the guide for the next task.
 2. In the **My Edits** group, you can replace the existing content in the sample documents with some of your content, apply the same paragraph and character styles and marker types available in the sample source documents to your content, and then generate and review output.
	
The instructions provided in the sample source documents to help you explore **ePublisher** assume that you already know how to work within your preferred authoring tool and file format. The documents give hints to help you along, but if at any point you feel you need a little more instruction, or if you have a question specific to your work flow just click on the “Contact Us” link in Next Steps.
	

# About the Sample ePublisher Express Trial Stationery

This trial uses the **ePublisher Express Trial Stationery**.  The **ePublisher** stationery is an electronic template that can be customized, in a purchased **ePublisher** seat, to your specific needs. It acts as your publishing assistant taking your style guide information and specific instructions, then executing to them every time it delivers content. Every **ePublisher Express** project is synchronized to stationery. **ePublisher Express** reads the content from the source documents, gets instructions from the synchronized stationery, and then publishes the output. 
	
The stationery for these source documents was created with **ePublisher Designer** back in the WebWorks lab. **ePublisher Designer** is for building stationery with custom styles, formatting information, and settings specific to your source documentation. **ePublisher Designer** also gives you the ability to set specific conditions that apply during the publishing process. The stationeries created by **ePublisher Designer** are portable, so they are usable with any **ePublisher Express** project. Using the **ePublisher** **One-Click Publishing** work flow allows us to privide you with a stationery already customized to the source documents supplied with this trial.
	
After this trial if you feel **ePublisher** might be the right solution for you, go to the Next Steps section in **ePublisher** **Express** to schedule a demo for **ePublisher** **Designer** so we can show you how to customize a stationery to your documents.

Adding Functional Elements to Online Content using ePublisher 

When delivering your content through an online medium, there are many online features that you can take advantage of to increase the experience of your audience. For example, online features such as **Expand/Collapse** sections, **Related Topics** links, and **Mini Table of Contents** (great for mobile outputs.) **ePublisher** makes it easy to incorporate these features into your output by simply marking sections of your source documents with the appropriate paragraph styles, character styles, marker types or output class. You do not need to write code for any of these features.
	
The following sections explain how to implement these features using the **ePublisher** system. You will use the proper paragraph or character styles, marker types or output class in the sample source documents to implement the following online features:

* [Expand/Collapse](#expand-and-collapse)
* [Related Topics](#relatedtopics)
* [Context-Sensitive Help Topics](#context-sensitive)
* [Mini Table of Contents for Mobile Devices](#minitoc) 

Then in the ["My Edits"](My_Edits.md) sections, you will see examples of how to incorporate different types of media assets using the proper syntax in Markdown. The next section will go over basic Markdown syntax as well as how to write custom **ePublisher** syntax.
