My Edits
--------- 

Welcome to your little slice of ePublisher Express Trial. This is your "My Edits" section. In this section, you will be able to add your content and then see it in the generated output. By now you should have a little bit of an idea of how ePublisher works. The trial is generating output from pre-built stationery synchronized to the ePublisher Express Trial project.

This document and the others have been imported to the Express project and appear in the Documents window. When you press the generation button, ePublisher opens each document and reads the information contained within. ePublisher will never change the source documents, it reads them for the content and the style names. We have customized the stationary to these source documents. Once you purchase a seat of ePublisher, you will be able to customize a project to your styles. This process is a detail in ePublisher Designer. For now, have some fun with the styles and space below we have provided for you. We left everything pretty simple, so feel free to use some of the skills you just learned in the previous document. You can create related topics, expand/collapse sections, or add some mini-TOCs. Remember to edit in this document, and use the style names provided. Once done, just save the file and publish with one click to see the results.

## Examples of Types of Text

First, I hope you take note of the font color in the above heading. Make sure to take a look at the generated
output. ePublisher ALWAYS generates blocks of content the exact way you specify. We want all our titles and
headings to be uniformed in the output regardless of how they appear in the source document.

Now we can get to the examples.

# Try Adding Some Pictures Or Links To Videos 

This section is for you to add your multimedia assets to get a feel for how they work with ePublisher. ePublisher
allows you to handle this in some ways. For now, we recommend just using the native functions of your authoring
tool to add your media assets inline. You will see them appear in the output in the same manner.

When you have a full seat of ePublisher, you will be able to change some of the asset behaviors in the generated
output, but for now, you can see how easy it is to add multimedia to your outputs.

## How to embed video in a Markdown Document 

In Markdown, ePublisher allows you to put HTML code directly in your documents and pass through on generation.
All you need to do is place the HTML code in the document and make sure it is not connected to any other text. 

In this example, I chose a video from Youtube and in the Share option, took the code.  

Here is the code I want to be integrated into to my output page:

```
<iframe
  width="660"
  height="375"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4QoQWboM-U"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```
<!--condition: onlineonly-->
and here is the result: 

<iframe 
  width="660"
  height="375"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4QoQWboM-U"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<!--/condition-->
It is that simple to embed video in your output using Markdown as your source.
