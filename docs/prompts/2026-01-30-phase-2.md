# Phase Two of Creating Trial Guide

- Add note about supporting other source document types.

- Change wait 30 seconds part of Step 2 to: Notice the log being generated and then there is a popup displaying when it is done. Then you can have it open generated output in browser.

- CTA needs to be stronger. Currently assumes they have Designer installed, but they probably don't. We want to encourage them to download it so they can customize and access the full ePublisher experience.

- Tone down "ruthlessly" downsized writing style.

- Better teasing of features before the CTA

- Optional section after CTA for seeing more features
  - Introduce Target Settings, mention output behavior is configurable
  - Show them target settings they can change, such as Header, Footer, Tabs at top
  - Final CTA, re-iterate getting Designer to change Reverb skin (Chrome) and even AutoMap for automation of documentation development and production workflows.
