# Update Express Trial Guide Source Documents

When the user installs ePublisher Express, a folder is created on their Windows system at: `Documents\ePublisher Express Projects\ePublisher Express Trial Project`. Inside that folder is a folder that contains example source documents that ePublisher Express can generate.

The Trial guide needs to reference these files in its instructions.

Update `express-trial-guide.md` to make sure it is clear how to access these files. If the user has never created a project, the "ePublisher Express Trial Project" will be opened automatically, otherwise they will need to open it manually by selecting the `.wrp` file in the folder.

Once generated the output of the project is quite complex and not very aesthetic. We need to consider simplifying the output, but without loosing the impact.

I have included the existing source docs of the Trial project in the folder `ePublisher Express Trial Project\Source Docs\`. Each folder contains the same content structure but for a different source authoring environment. The ones you will be analyzing are in the `Markdown` subfolder.
