# Initial Plan Prompt

Rewrite this ePublisher Express guide to first time users of Express.

## Audience

- Technical Documentation Writers
- Online Help Producers

## Background

- Original guide written to facilitate users of Microsoft Word, or Adobe FrameMaker, or DITA-XML source content.
- Original goal was to introduce users to the benefits of the ePublisher Platform and then specifically ePublisher Express.
- Evolved later to support Markdown++ as a source input.
- Eventually users would be introduced to ePublisher Designer, but this was their first exposure to ePublisher.
- Source documents were provided in all our supported input formats, but this lead to increased complexity and a general legacy feeling of ePublisher because of its use with Adobe FrameMaker and Microsoft Word.
- Existing published version of the ePublisher Express Trial Guide is at: https://static.webworks.com/docs/epublisher/latest/express/trial/

## New Goal

Efficiently sell the value of the ePublisher Platform for generating the most modern Online Help (HTML5) and PDF output in the most modern workflows to users unfamiliar with ePublisher that are evaluating it for purchase.
Use latest marketing/sales techniques for showing new users the value of ePublisher.

### Sub-goals

- Keep trial lean as possible and direct users to: https://static.webworks.com/docs/epublisher/latest/help/ for additional information on concepts.
- At least cut complexity by 50%. We are of the opinion that it is too complex and overwhelming.
- It should not "read like a book".
- Should provide a quick tour of how to use Express, not details such as "How to create Related Topics".
- At a minimum it should explain how to "Add source documents to a project".
- One approach might be: (1) pick a format, (2) generate it, (3) look at it.
- Other output formats exist, but they are either for migration to Markdown++ or less significant legacy output formats such as "Microsoft HTML Help" and should only be referred to tangentially.
- If the trial requires using existing source documents, as did the original, the provided source files should be Markdown++.
- In the near future, we will have a Trial Guides for AutoMap and Designer as well, but initially it will only be Express. We should not have to change too much, when those guides become available.
