# Update Source Documents in Trial Project

The Source Documents in the "ePublisher Express Trial Project" folder are dated, too long, and ugly to look at.

The proposed solution is to change out the Reverb skin (Chrome) to match the one that ePublisher's online help uses and to stream-line the source documents folder to a very simple Markdown++ file that showcases's the features of Reverb 2.0 as well as the PDF - XSL-FO formats.

To get ideas for what Markdown syntax, structure, and content to use, you can examine the repo at: C:\Projects\epublisher-docs, which includes a section on Markdown authoring at `legacy/authoring-source-documents/markdown`. This folder contains many markdown files as well as a top-level aggregator that includes the topic files.

The goal should be to keep the output organized and visibly appealing, making use of Markdown++ content islands, multiline tables, conditions, markers for Keywords/Description meta data, anchors for headings, and include directives.

The sample content need not be anything real, maybe interesting, but with the goal of demonstrating the value of Reverb 2 and PDF generation using ePublisher.
