## Sync Modes

$ProductName; offers three synchronization modes to accommodate different workflows and network conditions. You can switch between modes at any time through the application settings or system tray menu.

### Mode Comparison

| Mode | Best For | Bandwidth Usage | User Action Required |
|------|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Automatic | Always-connected devices with fast internet | High | None |
| Manual | Metered connections or limited bandwidth | Low | Trigger each sync |
| Selective | Devices with limited storage | Medium | Choose folders |

### Automatic Sync

In automatic mode, $ProductName; monitors your sync folder continuously and uploads changes immediately. Downloads from other devices occur as soon as they are available. This mode is ideal for desktop computers with reliable internet connections.

Automatic sync uses intelligent scheduling to avoid interfering with your work. Large uploads are throttled during active use and accelerated during idle periods.

### Manual Sync

Manual mode gives you complete control over when synchronization occurs. Changes are queued locally and only transmitted when you click the **Sync Now** button. This mode is useful when traveling or on metered cellular connections.

To perform a manual sync, right-click the $ProductName; icon in your system tray and select **Sync Now**, or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+S on Windows, Cmd+Shift+S on macOS).

### Selective Sync

Selective sync allows you to choose which cloud folders appear on each device. Folders not selected are hidden from your local sync folder but remain accessible through the web interface and other devices.

Use selective sync to:

- Conserve disk space on laptops with limited storage
- Keep work and personal files separate on different devices
- Avoid syncing large media archives to mobile devices

To configure selective sync, open Settings and navigate to the **Selective Sync** tab. Check the folders you want to sync to this device.

If you encounter sync issues after changing modes, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for resolution steps.
