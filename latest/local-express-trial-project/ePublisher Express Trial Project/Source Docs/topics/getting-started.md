## Getting Started

This guide walks you through the initial setup of $ProductName; on your device. The entire process takes approximately five minutes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A valid $ProductName; account (create one at quantumsync.example/signup)
- At least 500 MB of free disk space for the application
- An active internet connection for initial setup

### Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install and configure $ProductName;:

1. **Download the installer** - Visit quantumsync.example/download and select your operating system. The installer will download automatically.

2. **Run the installer** - Double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen prompts. Accept the license agreement and choose your installation directory.

3. **Sign in to your account** - When prompted, enter your email address and password. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, enter your verification code.

4. **Select your sync folder** - Choose the local folder where $ProductName; will store synchronized files. The default location is your Documents folder.

5. **Configure initial sync** - Select which existing cloud folders to sync to this device. You can change these settings later in [Settings](#settings).

> **Tip:** For the fastest initial sync, connect to a wired network if available. $ProductName; can download large file sets significantly faster over ethernet than Wi-Fi.
