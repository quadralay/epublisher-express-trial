# Quick Start

Generate your first professional HTML5 output in 3 clicks.

<!-- #add-documents -->
## Step 1: Add Documents

The **ePublisher Express Trial Project** opens automatically on first launch.

> **Returning user?** Choose **File > Open** and navigate to:
> `Documents\ePublisher Express Projects\ePublisher Express Trial Project\ePublisher Express Trial Project.wrp`

Add the sample source document to the Document Manager:

1. Click **View** > **Project Directory**
2. Open `Source-Docs`
3. Drag `quantum-sync.md` to the Document Manager

<!-- #generate -->
## Step 2: Generate

1. Verify the **Active Target** shows **WebWorks Reverb 2.0**
2. Click **Generate All**

You generated a complete documentation site from a single Markdown file. Here's what happened under the hood.

<!-- #what-you-just-did -->
### What You Just Did

ePublisher combines three things every time you click **Generate All**:

1. **Source documents** — Your Markdown++ files provided the content
2. **Stationery** — An electronic template that controlled the output design, layout, and behavior
3. **Target** — The output format (Reverb 2.0 in this trial, but also PDF, EPUB, and others)

Stationery is the key concept: it's a reusable set of publishing instructions that transforms any supported source format into polished output — without changing your source files.

> **Beyond Markdown:** ePublisher also processes Adobe FrameMaker, Microsoft Word, and DITA-XML source documents using the same Stationery workflow.

<!-- #try-these-features -->
### Try These Features

Open your generated output and try each of these:

| Action                              | What to Notice                              |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Type in the search box              | Instant results with breadcrumb context     |
| Drag browser edge narrower          | Responsive reflow, TOC collapses to menu    |
| Click any image                     | Lightbox zoom at full resolution            |
| Click the Share widget              | Stable link to that specific page           |
| Switch to PDF target, regenerate    | Same content, print-ready PDF output        |

### Customize Output Behavior

ePublisher Express includes configurable Target Settings. Access them via **Target** > **Target Settings**.

| Setting     | What It Controls                          |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Header**  | Logo, navigation bar, search placement    |
| **Footer**  | Copyright text, links, contact info       |
| **Tabs**    | Top navigation categories and groupings   |

<!-- #designer -->
### Take Full Control with Designer

Designer lets you create and customize the Stationery that Express uses to publish. With Designer you can:

- Define **brand identity** — colors, logos, typography
- Control **page layout** — TOC placement, content width, navigation structure
- Configure **search behavior** — result ranking, faceted filtering
- Add **output formats** — EPUB, Eclipse Help, HTML Help, and more

The workflow: designers create Stationery, then distribute it to authors who publish with Express.

[Download ePublisher Designer](https://webworks.com/products/epublisher/download) — installs alongside Express. Choose 32-bit or 64-bit Windows on the download page.

<!-- #automap -->
### Automate with AutoMap

AutoMap adds command-line and scheduled publishing to your workflow:

- **CI/CD integration** — trigger builds from Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or any pipeline
- **Scheduled publishing** — regenerate on a timer without manual intervention
- **AI agent access** — CLI interface for autonomous documentation workflows
- **Headless operation** — no GUI required, runs on build servers

The Landmark IDs and Knowledge Base from your Reverb output (Step 2) become even more powerful when AutoMap keeps them continuously updated.

[Download ePublisher AutoMap](https://webworks.com/products/epublisher/download) — works with your existing Express installation.
