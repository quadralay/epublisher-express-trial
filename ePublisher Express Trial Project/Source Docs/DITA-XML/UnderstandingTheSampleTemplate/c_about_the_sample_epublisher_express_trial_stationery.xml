Trial Stationery</title>
<shortdesc>This trial uses the <b><b>ePublisher</b> Express</b> Trial Stationery that was created using <b>ePublisher</b>
Designer.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>The <b>ePublisher</b> stationery is an electronic template that is designed for your specific needs.
	It acts as your publishing assistant taking your specific instructions and then executing to them
	every time it delivers content. Every <b><b>ePublisher</b> Express</b> project is synchronized to stationery. 
	<b><b>ePublisher</b> Express</b> reads the content from the source documents, gets instructions from the 
	synchronized stationery and then publishes the output.</p>
	<p>The stationery for these source documents was created with <b><b>ePublisher</b> Designer</b> back in the 
	WebWorks lab. <b><b>ePublisher</b> Designer</b> is for building stationery with customer styles, formatting 
	information, and settings specific to your source documentation. <b><b>ePublisher</b> Designer</b> also gives 
	you the ability to set specific conditions that apply during the publishing process. The 
	stationeries created by <b><b>ePublisher</b> Designer</b> are portable, so they are usable with any Express 
	project. Using the <b>ePublisher</b> work flow is how we are providing you with stationery already 
	customized to the source documents for this trial.</p>
	<p>During this trial you will be using the pre-built stationery with an <b><b>ePublisher</b> Express</b> project.
	After this trial if you feel <b>ePublisher</b> might be the right solution for you, go to the Next Steps 
	section in <b><b>ePublisher</b> Express</b> to schedule a demo for <b><b>ePublisher</b> Designer</b>.</p>
