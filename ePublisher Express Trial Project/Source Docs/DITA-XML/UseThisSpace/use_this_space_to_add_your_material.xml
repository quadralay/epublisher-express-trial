<title>Use This Space to Add Your Material</title>
  <shortdesc>Welcome to your little slice of ePublisher Express Trial. This is your
  “My Edits” section. In this section, you will be able to add your content and then
  see it in the generated output.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>By now you should have a little bit of an idea of how ePublisher works. The
	trial is generating output from pre-built stationery synchronized to the 
	ePublisher Express Trial project.This document and the others have been imported
	to the Express project and appear in the Documents window.</p>
    <p>When you press the generation button, ePublisher opens each document and reads
	the information contained within. ePublisher will never change the source 
	documents, it reads them for the content and the style names. We have customized
	the stationary to these source documents. Once you purchase a seat of ePublisher,
	you will be able to customize a project to your styles. This process is a detail
	in ePublisher Designer. For now, have some fun with the styles and space below we
	have provided for you. We left everything simple, so feel free to use some of the
	skills you just learned in the previous document. You can create related topics,
	expand/collapse sections, or add some mini Table of Contents. Remember to edit in
	this document and use the style names provided in the output class. Once done, 
	just save the file and 	publish with one click to see the results.</p>
