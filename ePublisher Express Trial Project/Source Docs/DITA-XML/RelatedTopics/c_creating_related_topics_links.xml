  Related topic links take users to other topics that content creators believe will provide users with useful
  information about the topic they are currently viewing. ePublisher can display related topics links as text
  in the generated output as well as in a related topics section below the content. In the sample ePublisher
  Express Trial stationery, the Stationery Designer configured the related topics links to display in the text
  and a related topics section at the bottom of the content.
  </p>
  <p>You create related topics links by applying a <xref href="../QuickReference/r_paragraph_formats.xml#i721408">
  RelatedTopic</xref> paragraph format to a list of   cross-references you want to display as related topics for a
  topic in your source documents. When you generated output, the list of cross-references will automatically display
  as related topic links with the style information in the stationery.
