<title outputclass="Heading 2 Relevance">This Paragraph Has Brown a Few Times And
 is on Top</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>This paragraph has a higher relevance attached to it through ePublisher and
	this is why it is on top. Video provides a powerful way to help you deliver a 
	message or show the steps in a procedure. When you click Online Video, you can
	paste the embed code for the video you want to add. You can also type a keyword
	to search online for the video that best fits your document. To make your document
	look professionally produced, Word provides header, footer, cover page, and text
	box designs that complement each other. For example, you can add a matching cover
	page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from
	the different galleries. Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated.</p>
    <p>When you click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and
	SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme. When you apply styles, your
	headings change to match the new theme. Save time in Word with new buttons that
	show up where you need them. To change the way a picture fits in your document,
	click it and a button for layout options appears next to it. When you work on a
	table, click where you want to add a row or a column, and then click the plus
	sign. Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts of
	the document and focus on the text you want.</p>
