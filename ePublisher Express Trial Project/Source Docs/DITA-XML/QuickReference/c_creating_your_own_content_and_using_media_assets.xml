<title>Creating Your Own Content And Using Media Assets</title>
<shortdesc>The previous sections showed you just a sample of the
power of ePublisher.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
  <p>We wanted to give you an area where you could use your content and possibly some
  of your media assets. This area is in the second “Group” of this trial. For more of
  an explanation of “Groups” check out our “Next Steps” section.</p>
  <p>If you have seen enough, and you would like to get some answers to specific 
  questions, you can contact us at 877-6-WEBWORKS or (877) 693-2967. Our sales 
  department can answer any questions or move you on to customizing an ePublisher 
  project with your documentation.</p>
