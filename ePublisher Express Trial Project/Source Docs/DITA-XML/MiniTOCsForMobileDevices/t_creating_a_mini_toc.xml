    <p>As in all the previous examples, the ePublisher systems allows the content creator
	to include special tags in the source documents. ePublisher will read these tags and
	then alter the HTML5 document set according to the instructions provided from the 
	ePublisher stationery. The steps below list how and where to add the tag to the source
	documents.

  </context>
  <steps>
    <step>
	  <cmd>Locate a topic in your source documents where you would like a Mini Table
	  of Contents to appear.</cmd>
	</step>
    <step>
	  <cmd>Apply a predetermined output class to the title within the &lt;Title&gt; element.</cmd>
	</step>
    <step>
	  <cmd>Save the source document</cmd>
	</step>
    <step>
	  <cmd>Use ePublisher to generate the HTML5 Document set.</cmd>
	</step>
    <step>
	  <cmd>In the generated HTML5 document set, navigate to the tagged area to verify
	  the mini Table of Contents was created. </cmd>
	</step>
  </steps>
  <result>
    <p>Those are the steps needed to generate a fully functional mini Table of Contents
	in an ePublisher generated HTML5 document set. This is just one of the several features
	ePublisher comes pre-programed with to help you get the most out of your documentation.
