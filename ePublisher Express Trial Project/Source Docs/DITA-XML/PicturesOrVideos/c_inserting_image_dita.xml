<title>Inserting an Image in DITA</title>
<shortdesc>In this section, the process on how to insert an image in to DITA will 
be included below. Use this space to insert any images you would like to see in ePublisher's
HTML5 document set.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
  <p>This information is from the OASIS website and can be found here:
  <xref href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.1/OS/langspec/langref/image.html">
  <b>TO OASIS</b></xref></p>
  <p><b>Image</b></p>
  <p>Include artwork or images in a DITA topic by using the <codeph>&lt;image&gt;</codeph>
  element. The <codeph>&lt;image&gt;</codeph> element has optional attributes that indicate
  whether the placement of the included graphic or artwork should be inline (like a button or 
  icon) or on a separate line for a larger image. There are also optional attributes
  that indicate the size to which the included graphic or artwork should be scaled. 
  An href attribute is required on the image element, as this attribute creates a 
  pointer to the image, and allows the output formatting processor to bring the 
  image into the text flow. To make the intent of the image more accessible for 
  users using screen readers or text-only readers, always include a description of 
  the image's content in the alt element.</p>
  <p><b>Example</b></p>
  <p><codeph>&lt;image href="bike.gif" placement="break"&gt;&lt;alt&gt;Two-wheeled
  bicycle&lt;/alt&gt;&lt;/image&gt;</codeph></p>
